	abstract = {Finding a combination between privacy and accountability in the online world is a challenge. Too little accountability supports problematic behaviour. Too little privacy undermines individual freedom and has a chilling effect. This paper describes the identity infrastructure of a new open source community platform called PubHubs. It combines local group conversations, via its own adaptation of Matrix, with proportional authentication of users, in local identity spaces. PubHubs thus achieves a combination of privacy and accountability. The technical core of the paper describes the cryptographic protocols for managing digital identities, via both personal attributes and local pseudonyms. Around this core, the roles of digital identities within the PubHubs platform are explained in functional terms, giving participants for instance more certainty about others in a conversation, or giving moderators new tools.},

	title = {Polymorphic {Encryption} and {Pseudonymisation} for {Personalised} {Healthcare}},
	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/411},
	abstract = {Polymorphic encryption and Pseudonymisation, abbreviated as PEP, form
a novel approach for the management of sensitive personal data,
especially in health care. Traditional encryption is rather rigid:
once encrypted, only one key can be used to decrypt the data. This
rigidity is becoming an every greater problem in the context of big
data analytics, where different parties who wish to investigate part
of an encrypted data set all need the one key for decryption.

Polymorphic encryption is a new cryptographic technique that solves
these problems. Together with the associated technique of polymorphic
pseudonymisation new security and privacy guarantees can be given
which are essential in areas such as (personalised) healthcare,
medical data collection via self-measurement apps, and more generally
in privacy-friendly identity management and data analytics.

The key ideas of polymorphic encryption are:
1. Directly after generation, data can be encrypted in a
`polymorphic' manner and stored at a (cloud) storage facility in
such a way that the storage provider cannot get access. Crucially,
there is no need to a priori fix who gets to see the data, so that
the data can immediately be protected.

For instance a PEP-enabled self-measurement device will store all its
measurement data in polymorphically encrypted form in a back-end data
base.

2. Later on it can be decided who can decrypt the data. This
decision will be made on the basis of a policy, in which the data
subject should play a key role.

The user of the PEP-enabled device can, for instance, decide that
doctors X,Y,Z may at some stage decrypt to use the data in their
diagnosis, or medical researcher groups A,B,C may use it for their
investigations, or third parties U,V,W may use it for additional
services, etc.

3. This `tweaking' of the encrypted data to make it decryptable by
a specific party can be done in a blind manner. It will have to be
done by a trusted party who knows how to tweak the ciphertext for
whom.

This PEP technology can provide the necessary security and privacy
infrastructure for big data analytics. People can entrust their data
in polymorphically encrypted form, and each time decide later to make
(parts of) it available (decryptable) for specific parties, for
specific analysis purposes. In this way users remain in control, and
can monitor which of their data is used where by whom for which
purposes.

The polymorphic encryption infrastructure can be supplemented with a
pseudonymisation infrastructure which is also polymorphic, and
guarantees that each individual will automatically have different
pseudonyms at different parties and can only be de-pseudonymised by
participants (like medical doctors) who know the original identity.

This white paper provides an introduction to Polymorphic Encryption
and Pseudonymisation (PEP), at different levels of abstraction,
focusing on health care as application area. It contains a general
description of PEP, explaining the basic functionality for laymen,
supplemented by a clarification of the legal framework provided by the
upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European
Union. The paper also contains a more advanced, mathematically
oriented description of PEP, including the underlying cryptographic
primitives, key and pseudonym managment, interaction protocols,
etc. This second part is aimed at readers with a background in
computer security and cryptography. The cryptographic basis for PEP is
ElGamal public key encryption, which is well-known since the mid
1980s. It is the way in which this encryption is used --- with
re-randomisation, re-keying and re-shuffling --- that is new.

The PEP framework is currently elaborated into an open design and open
source (prototype) implementation at Radboud University in Nijmegen,
The Netherlands. The technology will be used and tested in a real-life
medical research project at the Radboud University Medical Center.},

Professionals, students, politicians, and high-risk security individuals utilize these platforms to communicate with their colleagues. They blindly trust these platforms without understanding how secure they are, and their sensitive data may be vulnerable as it is transmitted through these third party platforms. Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams are the most popular among the platforms, and they are examined in this paper. These platforms’ security aspects were to be evaluated by simulating calls within a virtual environment, capturing the network traffic sent to/from the network, and analyzing the captured traffic to determine what information outside listeners had access to. It was discovered that these platforms utilized state-of-the-art encryption methods, but they did not provide end-to-end encryption since vendors as third parties have access to the end-user communication data. It was also discovered that some strange TCP connections were being established as well as unknown DNS communications. It also found TCP communications running in the background. This suggests that the platforms are not being transparent with users, and this could generate potential security concerns with users.},

Posting meeting images affects all participants, leading to an easy collection of personal data including age, gender and linkage with participation in other meetings. Here, we explored privacy issues that may be at risk by attending virtual meetings. We extracted private information from collage images of meeting participants that are publicly posted online. We used image processing, text recognition tools, as well as social network analysis to explore our curated dataset of over 15700 collage images, and over 142000 face images of meeting participants. We demonstrate that video conference users are facing prevalent security and privacy threats. Our results indicate that it is relatively easy to collect thousands of publicly available images of video conference meetings and extract personal information about the participants, including their face images, age, gender, usernames, and even full names. This type of data can vastly and easily jeopardize people’s security and privacy both in the online and real-world, affecting not only adults but also more vulnerable segments of society, such as children and older adults. Finally, we show that cross-referencing facial image data with social network data may put participants at additional privacy risks they may not be aware of and that it is possible to identify users that appear in several video conference meetings, thus providing a potential to maliciously aggregate different sources of information about a target individual.},

	abstract = {In this article, we consider security aspects of online meeting applications based on protocols such as WebRTC that leverage the Information-centric Networking (ICN) architecture to make the system fundamentally more scalable. If the scalability properties provided by ICN have been proved in recent literature, the security challenges and implications for real-time applications have not been reviewed. We show that this class of applications can benefit from strong security and scalability jointly without any major tradeoff and with significant performance improvements over traditional WebRTC systems. To achieve this goal, some modifications to the current ICN architecture must be implemented in the way integrity and authentication are verified. Extensive performance analysis of the architecture based on the open source implementation of Hybrid-ICN proves that real-time applications can greatly benefit from this novel network architecture in terms of strong security and scalable communications.},

	abstract = {Most video platforms deliver HD video in high bitrate encoding. Modern video-conferencing systems are capable of handling HD streams, but using multiparty conferencing, average internet connections in the home are on their bandwidth limit. For properly managing the encoding bitrate in videoconferencing, we must know what is the minimum bitrate requirement to provide users an acceptable experience, and what is the bitrate level after which QoE saturates?. Most available subjective studies in this area used rather dated technologies. We report on a multiparty study on video quality with HD resolution. We tested different encoding bitrates (256kbs, 1024kbs and 4096kbs) and packet loss rates (0, 0.5\%) in groups of 4 participants with a scenario based on the ITU building blocks task. We discuss the influence of group interaction and individual idiosyncrasies based on different mixed models, and look at covariates engagement and enjoyment as further explanatory factors. We found that 256kbs is still sufficient to provide a fair overall experience, but video quality is noticed to be poor. On the higher bitrate end, most people will not perceive the difference between 1024kbs and 4096kbs, considering in both cases the quality to be close to excellent. Independent on bitrate, packet loss has a small but significant impact, quantifiable in, on average, less than half a point difference on a 5-point ITU scale.},

	abstract = {Telemeetings such as audiovisual conferences or virtual meetings play an increasingly important role in our professional and private lives. For that reason, system developers and service providers will strive for an optimal experience for the user, while at the same time optimizing technical and financial resources. This leads to the discipline of Quality of Experience (QoE), an active field originating from the telecommunication and multimedia engineering domains, that strives for understanding, measuring, and designing the quality experience with multimedia technology. This paper provides the reader with an entry point to the large and still growing field of QoE of telemeetings, by taking a holistic perspective, considering both technical and non-technical aspects, and by focusing on current and near-future services. Addressing both researchers and practitioners, the paper first provides a comprehensive survey of factors and processes that contribute to the QoE of telemeetings, followed by an overview of relevant state-of-the-art methods for QoE assessment. To embed this knowledge into recent technology developments, the paper continues with an overview of current trends, focusing on the field of eXtended Reality (XR) applications for communication purposes. Given the complexity of telemeeting QoE and the current trends, new challenges for a QoE assessment of telemeetings are identified. To overcome these challenges, the paper presents a novel Profile Template for characterizing telemeetings from the holistic perspective endorsed in this paper.},
