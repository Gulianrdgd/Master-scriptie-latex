    abstract = {Finding a combination between privacy and accountability in the online world is a challenge. Too little accountability supports problematic behaviour. Too little privacy undermines individual freedom and has a chilling effect. This paper describes the identity infrastructure of a new open source community platform called PubHubs. It combines local group conversations, via its own adaptation of Matrix, with proportional authentication of users, in local identity spaces. PubHubs thus achieves a combination of privacy and accountability. The technical core of the paper describes the cryptographic protocols for managing digital identities, via both personal attributes and local pseudonyms. Around this core, the roles of digital identities within the PubHubs platform are explained in functional terms, giving participants for instance more certainty about others in a conversation, or giving moderators new tools.},

These multimedia data being transferred over an unsecured channel include sensitive and private information. This paper proposes a secure encryption scheme that selectively encrypts video chunk payload using an Ellipticcurve Diffie–Hellman-negotiated session key. The proposed scheme also provides security and authentication by using the AES-256-GCM encryption method to generate an encrypted packet with authentication. This paper evaluates the latency delays caused by the encryption algorithm, computing load consumption, and end-toend transmission latency for a real-world scenario. As a result, the proposed scheme aims to decrease the encryption latencies while providing strong session security and authenticity.},

    abstract = {Videoconferencing platforms have received a large influx of traffic due to COVID-19 and the global pandemic it has caused. Professionals, students, politicians, and high-risk security individuals utilize these platforms to communicate with their colleagues. They blindly trust these platforms without understanding how secure they are, and their sensitive data may be vulnerable as it is transmitted through these third party platforms. Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams are the most popular among the platforms, and they are examined in this paper. These platforms’ security aspects were to be evaluated by simulating calls within a virtual environment, capturing the network traffic sent to/from the network, and analyzing the captured traffic to determine what information outside listeners had access to. It was discovered that these platforms utilized state-of-the-art encryption methods, but they did not provide end-to-end encryption since vendors as third parties have access to the end-user communication data. It was also discovered that some strange TCP connections were being established as well as unknown DNS communications. It also found TCP communications running in the background. This suggests that the platforms are not being transparent with users, and this could generate potential security concerns with users.},

    abstract = {The unprecedented growth in video conferencing usage is accompanied by multiple security and privacy threats. Importantly, protecting users’ privacy is not always in their own hands. Posting meeting images affects all participants, leading to an easy collection of personal data including age, gender and linkage with participation in other meetings. Here, we explored privacy issues that may be at risk by attending virtual meetings. We extracted private information from collage images of meeting participants that are publicly posted online. We used image processing, text recognition tools, as well as social network analysis to explore our curated dataset of over 15700 collage images, and over 142000 face images of meeting participants. We demonstrate that video conference users are facing prevalent security and privacy threats. Our results indicate that it is relatively easy to collect thousands of publicly available images of video conference meetings and extract personal information about the participants, including their face images, age, gender, usernames, and even full names. This type of data can vastly and easily jeopardize people’s security and privacy both in the online and real-world, affecting not only adults but also more vulnerable segments of society, such as children and older adults. Finally, we show that cross-referencing facial image data with social network data may put participants at additional privacy risks they may not be aware of and that it is possible to identify users that appear in several video conference meetings, thus providing a potential to maliciously aggregate different sources of information about a target individual.},

We show that this class of applications can benefit from strong security and scalability jointly without any major tradeoff and with significant performance improvements over traditional WebRTC systems. To achieve this goal, some modifications to the current ICN architecture must be implemented in the way integrity and authentication are verified. Extensive performance analysis of the architecture based on the open source implementation of Hybrid-ICN proves that real-time applications can greatly benefit from this novel network architecture in terms of strong security and scalable communications.},

    abstract = {Most video platforms deliver HD video in high bitrate encoding. Modern video-conferencing systems are capable of handling HD streams, but using multiparty conferencing, average internet connections in the home are on their bandwidth limit. For properly managing the encoding bitrate in videoconferencing, we must know what is the minimum bitrate requirement to provide users an acceptable experience, and what is the bitrate level after which QoE saturates?. Most available subjective studies in this area used rather dated technologies. We report on a multiparty study on video quality with HD resolution. We tested different encoding bitrates (256kbs, 1024kbs and 4096kbs) and packet loss rates (0, 0.5\%) in groups of 4 participants with a scenario based on the ITU building blocks task. We discuss the influence of group interaction and individual idiosyncrasies based on different mixed models, and look at covariates engagement and enjoyment as further explanatory factors. We found that 256kbs is still sufficient to provide a fair overall experience, but video quality is noticed to be poor. On the higher bitrate end, most people will not perceive the difference between 1024kbs and 4096kbs, considering in both cases the quality to be close to excellent. Independent on bitrate, packet loss has a small but significant impact, quantifiable in, on average, less than half a point difference on a 5-point ITU scale.},

For that reason, system developers and service providers will strive for an optimal experience for the user, while at the same time optimizing technical and financial resources. This leads to the discipline of Quality of Experience (QoE), an active field originating from the telecommunication and multimedia engineering domains, that strives for understanding, measuring, and designing the quality experience with multimedia technology. This paper provides the reader with an entry point to the large and still growing field of QoE of telemeetings, by taking a holistic perspective, considering both technical and non-technical aspects, and by focusing on current and near-future services. Addressing both researchers and practitioners, the paper first provides a comprehensive survey of factors and processes that contribute to the QoE of telemeetings, followed by an overview of relevant state-of-the-art methods for QoE assessment. To embed this knowledge into recent technology developments, the paper continues with an overview of current trends, focusing on the field of eXtended Reality (XR) applications for communication purposes. Given the complexity of telemeeting QoE and the current trends, new challenges for a QoE assessment of telemeetings are identified. To overcome these challenges, the paper presents a novel Profile Template for characterizing telemeetings from the holistic perspective endorsed in this paper.},

We identify ten popular online meeting tools and extract posts containing meeting invitations to these platforms on a mainstream social network, Twitter, and on a fringe community known for organizing coordinated attacks against online users, 4chan. We then perform manual annotation to identify posts that are calling for zoombombing attacks, and apply thematic analysis to develop a codebook to better characterize the discussion surrounding calls for zoombombing. During the first seven months of 2020, we identify over 200 calls for zoombombing between Twitter and 4chan, and analyze these calls both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our findings indicate that the vast majority of calls for zoombombing are not made by attackers stumbling upon meeting invitations or bruteforcing their meeting ID, but rather by insiders who have legitimate access to these meetings, particularly students in high school and college classes. This has important security implications because it makes common protections against zoombombing, e.g., password protection, ineffective. We also find instances of insiders instructing attackers to adopt the names of legitimate participants in the class to avoid detection, making countermeasures like setting up a waiting room and vetting participants less effective. Based on these observations, we argue that the only effective defense against zoombombing is creating unique join links for each participant.},
