	abstract = {Polymorphic encryption and Pseudonymisation, abbreviated as PEP, form
a novel approach for the management of sensitive personal data,
especially in health care. Traditional encryption is rather rigid:
once encrypted, only one key can be used to decrypt the data. This
rigidity is becoming an every greater problem in the context of big
data analytics, where different parties who wish to investigate part
of an encrypted data set all need the one key for decryption.

Polymorphic encryption is a new cryptographic technique that solves
these problems. Together with the associated technique of polymorphic
pseudonymisation new security and privacy guarantees can be given
which are essential in areas such as (personalised) healthcare,
medical data collection via self-measurement apps, and more generally
in privacy-friendly identity management and data analytics.

The key ideas of polymorphic encryption are:
1. Directly after generation, data can be encrypted in a
`polymorphic' manner and stored at a (cloud) storage facility in
such a way that the storage provider cannot get access. Crucially,
there is no need to a priori fix who gets to see the data, so that
the data can immediately be protected.

For instance a PEP-enabled self-measurement device will store all its
measurement data in polymorphically encrypted form in a back-end data
base.

2. Later on it can be decided who can decrypt the data. This
decision will be made on the basis of a policy, in which the data
subject should play a key role.

The user of the PEP-enabled device can, for instance, decide that
doctors X,Y,Z may at some stage decrypt to use the data in their
diagnosis, or medical researcher groups A,B,C may use it for their
investigations, or third parties U,V,W may use it for additional
services, etc.

3. This `tweaking' of the encrypted data to make it decryptable by
a specific party can be done in a blind manner. It will have to be
done by a trusted party who knows how to tweak the ciphertext for
whom.

This PEP technology can provide the necessary security and privacy
infrastructure for big data analytics. People can entrust their data
in polymorphically encrypted form, and each time decide later to make
(parts of) it available (decryptable) for specific parties, for
specific analysis purposes. In this way users remain in control, and
can monitor which of their data is used where by whom for which
purposes.

The polymorphic encryption infrastructure can be supplemented with a
pseudonymisation infrastructure which is also polymorphic, and
guarantees that each individual will automatically have different
pseudonyms at different parties and can only be de-pseudonymised by
participants (like medical doctors) who know the original identity.

This white paper provides an introduction to Polymorphic Encryption
and Pseudonymisation (PEP), at different levels of abstraction,
focusing on health care as application area. It contains a general
description of PEP, explaining the basic functionality for laymen,
supplemented by a clarification of the legal framework provided by the
upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European
Union. The paper also contains a more advanced, mathematically
oriented description of PEP, including the underlying cryptographic
primitives, key and pseudonym managment, interaction protocols,
etc. This second part is aimed at readers with a background in
computer security and cryptography. The cryptographic basis for PEP is
ElGamal public key encryption, which is well-known since the mid
1980s. It is the way in which this encryption is used --- with
re-randomisation, re-keying and re-shuffling --- that is new.

The PEP framework is currently elaborated into an open design and open
source (prototype) implementation at Radboud University in Nijmegen,
The Netherlands. The technology will be used and tested in a real-life
medical research project at the Radboud University Medical Center.},

	abstract = {Finding a combination between privacy and accountability in the online world is a challenge. Too little accountability supports problematic behaviour. Too little privacy undermines individual freedom and has a chilling effect. This paper describes the identity infrastructure of a new open source community platform called PubHubs. It combines local group conversations, via its own adaptation of Matrix, with proportional authentication of users, in local identity spaces. PubHubs thus achieves a combination of privacy and accountability. The technical core of the paper describes the cryptographic protocols for managing digital identities, via both personal attributes and local pseudonyms. Around this core, the roles of digital identities within the PubHubs platform are explained in functional terms, giving participants for instance more certainty about others in a conversation, or giving moderators new tools.},
