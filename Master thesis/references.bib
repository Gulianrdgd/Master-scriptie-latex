    abstract = {Finding a combination between privacy and accountability in the online world is a challenge. Too little accountability supports problematic behaviour. Too little privacy undermines individual freedom and has a chilling effect. This paper describes the identity infrastructure of a new open source community platform called {PubHubs}. It combines local group conversations, via its own adaptation of Matrix, with proportional authentication of users, in local identity spaces. {PubHubs} thus achieves a combination of privacy and accountability. The technical core of the paper describes the cryptographic protocols for managing digital identities, via both personal attributes and local pseudonyms. Around this core, the roles of digital identities within the {PubHubs} platform are explained in functional terms, giving participants for instance more certainty about others in a conversation, or giving moderators new tools.},

    abstract = {The popularity of the video-streaming services raises demand in terms of security and less-latency. These multimedia data being transferred over an unsecured channel include sensitive and private information. This paper proposes a secure encryption scheme that selectively encrypts video chunk payload using an Ellipticcurve Diffie–Hellman-negotiated session key. The proposed scheme also provides security and authentication by using the {AES}-256-{GCM} encryption method to generate an encrypted packet with authentication. This paper evaluates the latency delays caused by the encryption algorithm, computing load consumption, and end-toend transmission latency for a real-world scenario. As a result, the proposed scheme aims to decrease the encryption latencies while providing strong session security and authenticity.},
